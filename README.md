<h>This project showcases the application of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in solving a real-world problem: efficient package delivery across a map or network.

By leveraging pathfinding techniques such as Dijkstra’s Algorithm, A*, or BFS/DFS, the system calculates optimal delivery routes between multiple drop-off points — just like how delivery services (e.g., G4S, Glovo, or Amazon Logistics) optimize their routes</h>
